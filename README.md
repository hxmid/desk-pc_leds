# desk-pc_leds
a little program that lets me control the led strips on my desk and in my pc via arduino
also lets me control the arduino using c# winforms, realistically you should be able to do this with any program that can handle serials, but i wanted to learn (?) c# so i did it in that... with .net framework
yes this is big brain time
