a little arduino sketch that lets me control the led strips on my desk and in my pc with a means control the arduino (by issuing commands) using c# serials with .net winforms, realistically you should be able to do this with any program that can handle serials, but i wanted to learn (?) c# so i did it in that... with .net framework

yes this is big brain time
